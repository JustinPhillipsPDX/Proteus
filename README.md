# Proteus 🐍

Proteus is a dynamic, cross-platform window and tiling manager designed to serve as the interactive layer for [Hermes 🦀](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/Hermes). With its adaptable design, Proteus empowers users to manage windows and workflows efficiently, integrating seamlessly with intelligent task and file management systems. Proteus is part of an ecosystem of tools that includes [SeaShell 🐚](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/SeaShell), which acts as the installation and build mechanism for the project.

## Features (Planned)
- **Dynamic Window Management**: Customizable tiling and stacking layouts.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Integration with Hermes**: Enhanced file and task management capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Keyboard-driven workflows with optional mouse support.
- **Theming and Customization**: Support for personalized layouts and styles.
- **Seamless Installation**: Uses [SeaShell 🐚](https://github.com/JustinPhillipsPDX/SeaShell) for cross-platform setup and build automation.
